## Getting Started

##CSS
The CSS code for this project is located in the styles.css file. It uses flexbox to create a responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices. The calculator has a container element with a fixed width and a flexible height, and contains two child elements: a result area and a button area.

The result area is a div element with a fixed height and a flexible width. It has a black border, a black text color, and a black background color. The text is aligned to the right and has a font size of 1.5em.

The button area is a div element with a flexible height and width. It contains a number of span elements that represent the calculator buttons. The buttons have a fixed height and width, a black border, and a gradient background color. The buttons are arranged in a grid using flexbox, with four buttons per row. The first button in each row has a left border, and the last button in each row has a different background color.
